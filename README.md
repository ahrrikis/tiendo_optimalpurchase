This module tries to improve Odoos PurchaseOrder generation by using linear programming. 
        Linear programming is a easy way for defining combinatorial problems, such as the Knappsack problem. 
        The Knappsack problem could be utilized to select the set suppliers a ProcurementOrder should be bought of. 
        For technical implementation the lpSolve-Solver shall be used.
